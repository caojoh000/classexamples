    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my web page! This is the first exammple from class. I hope you like it.
    <p>Here's another paragraph.
    I typed this line without another paragrapj tag, so it should appear right next to the previous sentence. The web page <b>doesn't</b> preserve te same spacing. It formats accordng to the tags it sees.
    So the line
    breaks
    are 
    different
    from the
    source also. <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph. </h2>
    
    <br><br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
