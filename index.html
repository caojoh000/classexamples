    <p>Welcome to my web page! This is the first exammple from class. I hope you like it.
   
    <p><a href="lists.html">Here</a> is a page with some different lists.
    
    <p><a href="schedule">Here</a> is my schedule as well!
      
    <p>Here's another paragraph.
    I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the previous sentence. The web page <b>doesn't</b> preserve te same spacing. It formats accordng to the tags it sees.
    So the line
    breaks
    are 
    different
    from the
    source also. <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph. </h2>
    
    <br><br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
    <p>Here is information about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
